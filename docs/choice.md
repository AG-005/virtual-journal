This article goes over an interpretion of choice, the underlying power it has and how it impacts our life in ways that we don't tend to think about consciously
___

## Can we choose unconsciously?
Right from a small choices on a day to day basis like what clothes to wear to major changing life decisions like what career to pursue, there is a common and influencial factor which is the power to choose what to do.

> _"Between every stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom"_ \
>_~ Victor E Frankel_

\
This thought may not be something that occurs to us naturally even though we go through the process regularly. The reason for that may be the unconscious execution of this process of choosing a response.\
\
If a response to any situation is a reflex or a conditioned response or a repeatedly practiced response, it loses the element of _choosing_ in the usual sense. \
For example, if a person touches a very hot vessel, the natural reflex is to instantly withdraw the hand. Technically, the person can still keep touching that vessel which would obviously be stupid in the usual sense because it would burn the finger.\
In this example one may be tempted to think that the choice is only an illusion as the right choice is obvious.\
The intention of this article is **not** to talk about the validity or the morality or the doability of the choice, as that is heavily circumstantial. 
The aim is to introduce the notion that in each and every situation, there is a choice.

## Isn't that trivial?
An obvious question especially considering the previous example would be, okay you say the choice of not taking your hand away from a hot vessel does exist, but isn't it useless?\
Isn't that as good as not having that choice in the first place?\
Because obviously almost no one would want to choose that, so doesn't that make its existence trivial and not worth talking about?\
\
These are extremely valid questions, and will hopefully be answered satisfactorily by the end of this article
