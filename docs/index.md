## The Path of 5 Cs
Inspired by and dedicated to the greynders<br><br>

### Consciousness
> Being aware of the environment, the problem, fear and their segregations, the and the possible practical solutions. 
> Being conscious about what matters when, prioritizing and finally being self aware. 

### Control
> Trying to limit just thinking, pause and ponder yet get into action mode. Redirecting your mind and focusing on important things

### Choice
> Sometimes when you think of your fears you know exactly what you want and don't want, what to hold on to and what to let go. Some parts of fear you keep with yourself even after you overcome them to keep yourself motivated but grounded. Fearlessly charging onto a tiger is a sign of stupidity and probably the last signs one will show in that case.

### Confidence
> Believing in yourself, that you can do it, that you can overcome it.
> Kyu nahi?

### Conviction
> The conviction that I will do something different, something big and meaningful.<br>
> The conviction that fear is just one obstacle of the path I walk, and that I am made of something bigger than this.<br>
> I need to get rid of this and actualize by best self if I am to attempt that big, noble and meaningful thing<br>
> This is the thread that ties everything together
