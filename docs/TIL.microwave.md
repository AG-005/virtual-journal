### How a microwave works
_Source:_ [[How a microwave oven works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp33ZprO0Ck)<br>
- Excitation of H2O molecules by a high frequency wave causes excitation and oscillations
- Result in production of thermal energy and heating of the item
- Produces heat node and antinode pattern(refer video) according to wavelength of the micro _wave_

- MyNote: Hence metals which do not have H2O molecules are not supported in most microwaves
Utensils which are microwave safe must have molecules which have a similar exitability effect
