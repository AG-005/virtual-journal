This article goes over an interpretion of choice, the underlying power it has and how it impacts our life in ways that we don't tend to think about consciously

## Can we choose unconsciously?
Right from a small choices on a day to day basis like what clothes to wear to major changing life decisions like what career to pursue, there is a common and influencial factor which is the power to choose what to do.

> _"Between every stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom"_ \
>_~ Victor E Frankl_

\
This thought may not be something that occurs to us naturally even though we go through the process regularly. The reason for that may be the unconscious execution of this process of choosing a response.\
\
If a response to any situation is a reflex or a conditioned response or a repeatedly practiced response, it loses the element of _choosing_ in the usual sense. \
\
For example, if a person touches a very hot vessel, the natural reflex is to instantly withdraw the hand. Technically, the person can still keep touching that vessel which would obviously be stupid in the usual sense because it would burn the finger.\
\
In this example one may be tempted to think that the choice is only an illusion as the right choice is obvious.\
\
The intention of this article is **not** to talk about the validity or the morality or the doability of the choice, as that is heavily circumstantial. 
The aim is to introduce the notion that in each and every situation, there is a choice.

## Isn't that trivial?

An obvious question especially considering the previous example would be, okay you say the choice of not taking your hand away from a hot vessel does exist, but isn't it useless?\
Isn't that as good as not having that choice in the first place?\
Because obviously almost no one would want to choose that, so doesn't that make its existence trivial and not worth talking about?\
\
These are extremely valid questions, and will hopefully be answered satisfactorily by the end of this article

## Why does it matter to think about these things?
Every single thing to ever materialize or actualize at the hands of any human being was incepted as a thought, conscious or unconscious.\
Thoughts are driven by external and internal factors, and emotions are a big part of that.\
Emotions influence our day to day as well as year to year lives. In better words, they matter in the short term as well as in the long run.\
\
It is useful to have a grip over one's emotions. A grip in which one does not 'control' or 'suppress' their emotions, yet does not let any emotion _completely_ control their actions. Such a grip is highly likely to lead to better decisions and outcomes.\
\
If you disagree with the above lines, this article is not for you.\
\
At the heart of any decision is a combination of conscious and unconscious thoughts, some of which are driven by or highly influenced by emotions. The job of this section is not to break down and understand emotions. It is to establish their impact on decisions. The degree to which an emotion or a set of emotions influences a decision is variable from person to person and situation to situation.\
\
When a decision is mainly driven by any emotion, the degree of conscious thought, reasoning and analysis behind it is marginally low.\
This **does not** comment in any way about the _validity, morality or correctness_ of such a decision. The purely objective point to note is that these decisions are not taken after due consideration of the possible consequences, or many times **conscious considerations of other possible choices** for that decisions.\
\
They are more likely to be quick and could be termed as impulsive or seemingly _obvious_(what else was I supposed to do?). A very important repeated note that this is in no way treating these types of decisions as negative, undesirable, incorrect or careless. This is not the intention at all, nor is it the truth. This is just a purely objective description of the nature of such decisions. This in no way means to demean the person taking such a decision or the decision itself. That judgement is _highly circumstantial_. 
> ### Thats a lot of description, an example would help!
> A decision like instantly swearing back when someone swears at you and _you don't like it_ could be one seemingly trivial example. It helps the case because for most this would be a natural and instant response. And yet this is a choice that every person is capable of making in every such instance. The proof for that is the existence of both people who swear and people who do not in the worst and most insulting situations.\
\
This does not mean that either of the choices is better in any sense. The point is to establish that this is a choice, much like everything else that one does.\
Another example could be (?)

Another type pf decision that is similar in nature in terms of being unconscious are trivial, small scale decisions which don't need any complicated thought process. These are usually delegated to sub-conscious decision making parts of the brain which automates them without much conscious effort necessary.\
\
If you have followed till here, the question\
 _what's the point of all this discussion?_\
 would be very natural. Here's the answer.

 ## So what?
 
 The above description was a setup for this proposition.
 >### Proposition:
 >Every single decision and action that a human makes is a choice.
 \Even in seemingly obvious and trivial situations, every single thing that someone says or does(broadly) is a choice.


 The choice may be conscious or unconscious.\
 The choice may be trivial or non trivial.\
 The choice may not be easy to identify as a choice itself which is what drives this article in the first place.

This proposition comes with a disclaimer much longer than the proposition itself. And this entire article can be considered as an extension of the disclaimer in some sense. This is necessary because of the subtleties involved and the scope for multiple misinterpretations of the proposition


 >### Disclaimer:
 > The proposition statement in isolation can be very misleading, and even stupid. The entire article goes over a detailed description of the intended interpretation. To think of it in any other way would be the reader's personal _choice_.\
 \
 > This proposition may also seem obvious and irrelevant. Obvious in cases when in general one may easily say 'I had no choice', and irrelevant in other cases where the availability of choices is clear. (Like choosing which clothes to wear)
 >Interestingly enough, this is the **exact** reason to think about it consciously.
